## Making changes to Eucalypt

- **Add specs**: Your pull request won't be accepted if it doesn't have any specs.

- **Document any change in behaviour**: Make sure the README, GitBook documentation and all other relevant documentation is kept up-to-date.

- **Create topic branches**: Will not pull from your master branch!

- **One pull request per feature**: If you wish to add more than one new feature, please make multiple pull requests.

- **Meaningful commit messages**: Make sure each individual commit in your pull request has a meaningful message.

- **De-clutter commit history**: If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before making your pull request.

### Branch naming conventions

Branch names must be of the form `type/short-phrase-or-description`, where `type` is either a:

- `patch`: Making a change to an existing feature.
- `add`: Adding a new feature.
- `rm`: Removal of an existing feature.

Branches should typically feature only one main change. If making multiple unrelated changes, please create separate branches and open separate pull requests.

### Making pull requests

**Ensure you use the [pull request template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).**

Pull request titles must be of the form `[type:specifier] Pull request title`, where `type` is the same as the branch type (read above).

The `specifier` should be one of:

- `lib`: Changes to any code in the `lib` directory.
- `gem`: Changes to any gem related things, such as `eucalypt.gemspec`, `Rakefile` or dependencies.
- `ci`: Changes to `.travis.yml` or `.coveralls.yml`.
- `specs`: Changes to any code in the `specs` directory.
- `git`: Changes to any Git-related code, such as `.gitignore`.

Continuous integration (Travis CI) builds must pass in order for your pull request to be merged.
